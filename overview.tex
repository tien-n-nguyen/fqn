Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows the overview of {\tool}.  The
state-of-the-art approaches in using pre-training language models
often follow the pre-train-the-fine-tuing paradigm. The pre-training
is task-agnostic and the fine-tuning usually suffers from the
insufficient supervised training data. In {\tool}, inspiring by Gu
{\em et al.}~\cite{gu-emnlp20}, we use a three-stage solution with the
addition of the task-guided pre-training stage that is {\em dedicated
  to learning API usage patterns} to help with the fully-qualified
name detection task.

The first stage is dedicated to the general pre-training on source
code to help {\tool} learn the general lexical, syntax, and semantic
characteristics of source code. For this purpose, we use
CodeBERT~\cite{} in which we randomly mask 15\% tokens and train the
model to reconstruct the original code tokens.

The second stage is aimed to effectively and efficiently learn the
{\em API usage patterns} and {\em the dependencies among API elements
  and the relevant program elements} in source code. From the source
code without any labels (unlabeled data), we apply a selective masking
strategy to focus on maksing the important tokens for the FQN
discovery task. From the motivation and key ideas, we identify as
important the tokens corresponding to the API elements and relevant
program entities via the API usage relations/dependencies. Note that
the training data at this stage unlabeled as in the general
pre-training stage. We expect that the model will learn the API usage
patterns and relations among the code elements that complement to the
general knowledge learned from the general pre-training stage. The
details on our selective masking are presented later.

The fine-tuning stage is dedidated to the task of recovering the FQNs
in source code. It will be trained with the labeled data, i.e., with
the FQNs. We can obtain such labeled data by running a program
analysis tool or a compiler on a complete code.
