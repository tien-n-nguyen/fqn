\subsection{Effectiveness on Complete Java Code (RQ\textsubscript{1})}
\label{sec:rq1}

In Table~\ref{tab:eff-eval2}, we report a comparison of model performance for FQN resolution. We can see that we outperform the state-of-the-art MLM\textsubscript{FIB} (by Huang et al.~\cite{prompt-ase22}) on all three evaluation metrics. Overall, we achieve a gain in performance of 9.1\% in the much stricter \textit{Accuracy\textsubscript{EM}}, and 1.1\%, 16.67\% in the more relaxed \textit{ROUGE-L} and \textit{BLEU-2} evaluation metrics.
