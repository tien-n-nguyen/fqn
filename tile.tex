\subsubsection{AST Parsing} As a first step towards building \code{<blank>}-sequences, we need to build the AST for a given code snippet. In cases where it is complete, constructing an AST is trivial. In cases where it is incomplete, we can utilize tools such as PPA~\cite{} to build an AST in a best-effort manner.

\subsubsection{Node Transformation}

\subsubsection{AST Unparsing}



Next, we traverse the AST and transform the source code corresponding to each of the type-specific AST nodes as follows:

%\input{tile_rules_descript}
\input{tile_rules_table}
