We can see in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} that building an intrinsic knowledge base across a wider dependency context (i.e., $B_w$) helps \tool significantly outperform the ablation baseline trained on a narrower surrounding context (i.e., $B_n$), achieving a relative improvement of 157.14\%, 47.54\%, and 59.65\% in \textit{Accuracy\textsubscript{EM}}, \textit{ROUGE-L}, and \textit{BLEU-2} scores, respectively. 

Consider the \code{junit.framework.Assert} class in the \textit{JUnit} unit testing framework which contains a set of assertion methods useful for writing tests. More recently, the \code{Assert} class in \code{junit.framework} has been deprecated, and moved to \code{org.junit.Assert}. In our dataset, about 98.89\% API elements that belong to \code{junit.framework.Assert} class are referenced in the \code{gwt} library; and about 97.4\% belonging to \code{org.junit.Assert} are in the \code{hibernate} library. We studied the performance of our ablation baselines ($B_n$ and $B_w$) on these APIs. We noticed that in the absence of dependency context, $B_n$ incorrectly predicts APIs belonging to \code{junit.framework.Assert} 35.53\% of the time, and those in \code{org.junit.Assert} 30.75\% of the time. In contrast, $B_w$ makes such incorrect predictions only 9.14\% and 8.19\% of the time, respectively. The additional contextual knowledge in the form of inter-API dependencies available in $B_w$ likely contributed to its understanding that the same API element, e.g., \code{assertEquals}, when referenced in the \code{gwt} library corresponds to \code{junit.framework.Assert.assertEquals}; and when referenced in the \code{hibernate} library corresponds to \code{org.junit.Assert.assertEquals}. Thus, we qualitatively and quantitatively corroborate \textit{Key Idea 2} by showing the role of context in FQN resolution.
