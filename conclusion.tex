\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we present {\tool}, a deep learning-based approach that
addresses these issues by formulating FQN resolution as a
\textit{fill-in-the-blank} task. For a given code snippet, our tool
systematically identifies all API locations, inserts a blank ahead of
the simple name corresponding to the API, leverages a causal language
model (CLM) to fill the missing blank with the corresponding FQN.  Our
empirical evaluation shows relatively improves over the
state-of-the-art FQN resolution approaches by 9.1\% on real-world code
snippets. Upon further analysis, we were able to tie the performance
improvement to our tool's capabilities to capture dependencies between
the API and other program elements in the code snippet.


\section{Data Availability}

The model and data is available in our website~\cite{deepfqn}.
