\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Software libraries play an important role in software
development. Their functionality is provided via Application
Programming Interface (API) elements including classes, methods, and
fields. Developers should follow the usage documentation of software
libraries to use the API elements in a specific combination to
accomplish certain programming tasks. Such usages are called {\em API
  usages}. The frequently occurring API usages are called~{\em
  API~usage patterns}. Several approaches have been leveraging API
usages and/or patterns to support software engineering tasks such as
pattern-based code completion~\cite{icse12}, API method
completion~\cite{fse16}, API usage recommendation~\cite{icsme18}, API
code migration~\cite{ase14}, fully-qualified name
suggestion~\cite{icse18}, API documentation
suggestion~\cite{liveapi14}, etc.

To use API elements correctly, developers could rely on API
documentation or online forums, e.g., StackOverflow or GitHub
Gists. Unfortunately, due to the context of the ongoing discussions in
such forums, the code snippets in the answering StackOverflow posts
may contain the ambiguities on the references to the API elements of
the external libraries~\cite{liveapi14}.

Several approaches have been proposed to automatically resolve the
fully qualified names (FQNs) of the API elements for a code
snippet. The approaches can be classified into different
categories. The first category is {\em program analysis}. Partial
program analysis~\cite{dagenais-oopsla08} derives the types/FQNs by
analyzing the relations among program elements in a best-effort
manner. RecoDoc~\cite{dagenais-icse12} utilizes several heuristics on
syntactic constructs to recognize the names. The key issue with
best-effort analysis and heuristics is that they might not work in all
the cases. The second category is {\em information retrieval}
(IR). Baker~\cite{liveapi14} builds a candidate list for each name by
tracking the scopes of the names and then overlapping the lists
according to the scoping rules for short-listing.
COSTER~\cite{coster-ase19} captures the context of the query API
element and matches that with the FQNs of API elements with three
criteria on likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity.  The
third category is {\em constraint-based}. SnR~\cite{snr-icse22} builds
a knowledge base of APIs, i.e., various facts about the available
APIs. SnR extracts typing constraints from the given snippet, and
solves the constraints against the knowledge base. The key limitation
with the IR and constraint-based approaches is that the dictionary of
the APIs must be known a priori, thus, they cannot deal with the FQNs
that have not been seen before in the training corpus.

To address that, several approaches leverage the advances in {\em
  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
  (ML)}. StatType~\cite{icse18} considers the problem of deriving FQNs
as the {\em phrase-based machine translation} from the code without
FQNs to the one with them. The key issue with StatType is that with
its short phrases of code tokens, it does not capture well the
relations of the APIs in the surrounding context, which is important
in helping decide the FQNs from the simple names of the API elements.
%
Huang {\em et al.}~\cite{prompt-ase22} formulates this problem as a
task of filling in a blank with a FQN using a large language model.
The approach collects as a training instance a code snippet consisting
of one simple name for an API element and a couple lines before and
after that name. Thus, if those surrounding lines do not contain any
simple names, the model could not take advantage of the relations
among the API elements to derive their FQNs. In other words, while
using the context of a few lines, it does not leverage the {\em
  dependency context} among the API elements for FQN prediction.

%Need a small example
%Take as an example a code snippet (not shown) in our dataset with the
%presence of \code{getText}. This name is popular with a very large
%number of API method candidates. However, considering the relation
%between \code{css} and \code{getText} in the code
%\code{`...css()\-.getText()'},~the number of candidates for
%\code{getText} is only 4. Finally, considering~the return value of
%\code{getText} as an argument of \code{setInnerText(...)} in the code
%\code{`setInnerText(...css()\-.getText())'}, only one candidate is
%remained:
%\code{com\-.google\-.gwt\-.resources\-.client\-.CssResource\-.getText()}.
%Thus, those relations actually help identify the API elements,

We introduce ML-based {\tool} to recover the FQNs for all the APIs in
any code snippet. Instead of characterizing the context with a few
lines before and after the location of an API element to derive its
FQN, we leverage the dependencies and relations among the API elements
in API usages to decide the FQNs for all the relevant APIs at once. We
consider the FQNs as the identities of the API elements and we follow
the philosophy {\em ``Tell Me Your Friends, I'll Tell You Who You
  Are''} to derive the FQNs. To determine the ``friends'' of an API
element $A$, we leverage the program entities and other API elements
that depend on and/or have relations with $A$. The software library
designers always have the intents for users to use certain API
elements together in the specific combinations/orders to achieve a
programming task. Such combinations of API elements are often referred
to as {\em API usages}. Therefore, such API elements in API usages
frequently occur together in the code using the libraries, which are
referred to as {\em API usage patterns}.

That {\em basis of regularity of API usages} drives our approach in
two ways. First, the API elements with their FQNs regularly appear
together in API usages have higher impact in deciding the FQNs than
the less regular ones. Thus, a ML model could {\em learn such
  regularly co-appearing API elements from a training corpus to help
  derive their FQNs at once}. We leverage the complete, compilable
code from the open-source code repositories using the libraries in
which the FQNs of all the API elements are available. Second, {\em the
  program dependencies and usage relations among API elements are
  useful in deriving their identities (i.e., FQNs)}. For example, in
the following two statements: \code{Button b = new Button(``OK'');}
\code{b\-.addClickHandler\-(\-new ClickHandler\-())}. The class name
\code{Button} is very popular across several libraries (e.g.,
\code{Button} appears in both Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and
\code{Android} library). Relying solely on the first statement might
not be sufficiently to derive the FQNs for the API elements
\code{Button}, \code{addClickHandler}, and \code{ClickHandler}, and
the variable \code{b}. However, the \code{def-use} dependency between
two statements via the variable \code{b} could give a model a hint on
the FQNs of all the elements.  If a model learns in the training
corpus that a GWT \code{Button} can be a receiving object of a method
call \code{addClickHandler}, which in turn accepts as the
argument an object of the type \code{ClickHandler}, it will be able to
derive the FQNs for the elements in both statements at once.

Putting together those ideas, we design {\tool}, ...

We performed several experiments to evaluate {\tool}. ...
