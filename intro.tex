\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Software libraries and frameworks play important roles in software
development. Their functionality is provided via the Application
Programming Interface (API) elements including classes, methods, and
fields. The online forums, e.g., StackOverflow or GitHub Gists, have
provided an excellent resource on how to use API
elements. Unfortunately, due to the current context of the discussions
in such forums, the code snippets in the answering StackOverflow posts
may contain the ambiguities on the references to the API elements of
the external libraries~\cite{liveapi14}.

Several approaches have been proposed to automatically resolve the
fully qualified names (FQNs) of the API elements for the code snippets
in the public forums.  The approaches can be classified into different
categories. The first category is {\em program analysis}. Partial
program analysis~\cite{dagenais-oopsla08} derives the types and FQNs
in a best-effort manner. RecoDoc~\cite{dagenais-icse12} utilizes
several heuristics on syntactic constructs to recognize the names.
The second category is {\em information
  retrieval}. Baker~\cite{liveapi14} builds a candidate list for each
name by tracking the scopes of the names and then overlapping the
lists according to the scoping rules to narrow down the candidates.
COSTER~\cite{coster-ase19} captures the context of the query API
element and matches that with the FQNs of API elements with three
criteria on likelihood, context similarity, and name similarity.  The
third category is {\em constraint-based}.  SnR~\cite{snr-icse22}
builds a knowledge base of APIs, i.e., various facts about the
available APIs.  SnR extracts typing constraints from the given
snippet, and solves the constraints against the knowledge base. The
fourth category leverages the advances in {\em artificial intelligence
  (AI) and machine learning (ML)}. StatType~\cite{icse18} considers
the problem of deriving FQNs as the machine translation from the code
without FQNs to the one with them. Huang {\em et
  al.}~\cite{prompt-ase22} formulate the problem as a fill-in-blank
task using a masked language model. The approach fills in the FQN for
each name considering the context consisting of the few lines before
and after the fill-in location.  The key issue is that the API
elements are designed to use in different client code, making the
surrounding contexts different for different code using the APIs.

Instead of characterizing the surrounding context of the location of
an API element to derive its FQN, we leverage the dependencies and
relations among the API elements in API usages to decide the FQNs at
once. We consider the FQNs as the identities of the API elements and
we follow the philosophy {\em ``Tell Me Your Friends, I'll Tell You
  Who You Are''} to derive the FQNs. To determine the ``friends'' of
an API element $A$, we leverage the program entities and other API
elements that depend and/or have relations with $A$. The software
library designers always have the intents for users to use certain API
elements together in the specific combinations/orders to achieve the
programming tasks. Such combinations of API elements are often
referred to as {\em API usages}. Therefore, such API elements in API
usages frequently occur together in the code using the libraries,
which are referred to as {\em API usage patterns}.

That {\em basis of regularity of API usages} drives our approach in
two ways. First, the API elements with their FQNs regularly appear
together in API usages have higher impact in deciding the FQNs than
the less regular ones. Thus, a ML model could {\em learn such regularly
co-appearing API elements from a training corpus to help derive their
FQNs at once}. We leverage the complete, compilable code using the
libraries from open-source code repositories in which the FQNs of all
the API elements are available. Second, {\em the program dependencies and
usage relations among API elements are useful in deriving their
identities (i.e., FQNs)}. For example, in the following code:
\code{Button b = new Button(``OK'');} \code{b\-.addClickHandler\-(\-new
    ClickHandler\-())}. The class name \code{Button} is very popular
  across several libraries (e.g., \code{Button} appears in both Google
  Web Toolkit (GWT) and \code{Android} library). Relying solely on the
  first statement might not be sufficiently to derive the FQNs for the
  API elements \code{Button}, \code{addClickHandler}, and
  \code{ClickHandler}, and the variable \code{b}. However, the
  \code{def-use} dependency between two statements via the variable
  \code{b} could give a model a hint on the FQNs of all the elements.
  If a model learns in the training corpus that a GWT \code{Button}
  can be a receiving object of a method call \code{addClickHandler},
  which in turn accepts as the single argument an object of the type
  \code{ClickHandler}, it will be able to derive the FQNs for the
  elements in both statements at once.

Putting together those ideas, we design {\tool}, ...

We performed several experiments to evaluate {\tool}. ...

The key contributions of this paper include:

1. {\tool}: a neural-network approach ...


2. An extensive evaluation showing {\tool}'s better accuracy in
deriving FQNs than the state-of-the-art approaches.

3. An analysis showing the embeddings for the API elements ...
