\subsection{Effectiveness on Incomplete Java Code (RQ\textsubscript{4})}
\label{sec:rq4}

In Table~\ref{tab:results-practical}, we report the performance of our model for incomplete Java code snippets. We observed that the fully-qualified names predicted by {\tool} exactly match the ground-truth fully-qualified names for \code{gwt}, \code{hibernate}, and \code{xstream} with an accuracy of 69.23\%, 40.00\%, and 20.83\%, respectively. Among the three tested libraries from the StatType-SO dataset, we achieved the best performance overall, across all metrics in the \code{gwt} library, and \tool faced the most difficulty with \code{xstream}.
