\subsection{Research Questions}

We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool}. We aim to
answer the following questions:

\vspace{2pt}
%\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}. [Effectiveness on Java code]
%  (Intrinsic Evaluation).} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in generating
%  CFG/PDGs for Java code in general and in different dependency
%  types?}

\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}. [Effectiveness on Java code]
%  (Intrinsic Evaluation)} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in generating
%  CFG/PDGs for Java code in general, and for different dependence
%  relations?}
  (Intrinsic Evaluation)} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in generating CFG/PDGs for Java code? How about specific dependency relations?}
  
%{\em How accurate are the control-flow and
%            program-dependency edges generated by \tool for Java code?
%            How accurately does \tool predict different types of
%            control-flow and program-dependency edges for Java code?}


\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2}. [Ablation Study].} {\em How do
  the different components in \tool contribute to its performance?}

(Extrinsic Evaluation).}  {\em How do the predicted PDGs
    from \tool approximate the extrinsic task of bug detection on full
    code?}
