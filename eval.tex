%\subsection{Research Questions}

We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool}. We aim to answer the following questions:

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1} 
  [Effectiveness Evaluation]} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in expanding FQNs for complete code from Java projects?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2} [Probing for API-Usage Relations]} {\em Is our tool capable of capturing the API-usage relations between the API elements and other program elements in the code snippet?}
%{\em Is our tool capable of capturing the API-usage relations between API elements and other program elements in the code snippet?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3} 
[Ablation Study]}  {\em Is there a benefit to leveraging a wider dependency context in comparison to a narrower surrounding context for predicting fully qualified names?}

\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3} 
[Practicality Evaluation]}  {\em How accurate is {\tool} in 
inferring FQNs for API elements in incomplete code snippets from online forums such as StackOverflow?}
