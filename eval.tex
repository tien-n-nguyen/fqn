%\subsection{Research Questions}

We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool}. We aim to answer the following questions:

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1} 
  [Effectiveness Evaluation]} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in expanding FQNs for complete code from Java projects?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2} 
  [Effectiveness Evaluation]} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in expanding FQNs for incomplete code from StackOverflow?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3}
[API-Usage Relations]} {\em Do the conditioning-driven interactions help our tool learn API usages?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{4} 
  [Ablation Study]}  {\em Is there a benefit to leveraging a wider context in comparison to a narrower surrounding context for predicting fully qualified names?}



%{\em Is our tool capable of capturing the API-usage relations between API elements and other program elements in the code snippet?}

% \vspace{2pt}
% \noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{4} 
% [Practicality Evaluation]}  {\em How accurate is {\tool} in 
% inferring FQNs for API elements in incomplete code snippets from online forums such as StackOverflow?}
