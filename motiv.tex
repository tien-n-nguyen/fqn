\subsection{Motivating Examples}
\label{examples:sec}

\input{example1.tex}

Let us use a few real-world examples to motivate our approach.
Fig.~\ref{fig:example1} displays a code snippet of an answer~to the
S/O question \#4531500 on Android library. Due to the discussion
context in S/O, code snippets rarely contain sufficient declarations
and references to the fully-qualified names (FQNs). The code snippets
are often missing necessary import statements and the references to
the external types are also unqualified since the responder assumes
that those FQNs can be implicitly understood in the context of the
post. For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:example1}, the types
\code{Button} (line 1), \code{EditText} (line 2), \code{Bundle} (line
4), \code{View} (line 14), or \code{Log} (line 16) are referenced
only by simple names. Thus, the code will not be compilable if
the needed import statements are not added.

\input{example2.tex}

Importantly, the name ambiguity occurs in the references to the APIs
of the external libraries. For example, the type \code{Button} at line
1 of Fig.~\ref{fig:example1} is a common unqualified type name. In
this snippet, it refers to \code{android.widget.Button}. However, it
is ambiguous with other APIs in different libraries that contain the
same concept. For example, Fig.~\ref{fig:example2} shows a code
snippet of an answer for an S/O post on Google Web Toolkit
(GWT). Because the code snippet contains no import statement, and the
references to the APIs are unqualified, the type \code{Button} at line
2 of Fig.~\ref{fig:example2} is ambiguous with the type of the same
name at line 1 of Fig.~\ref{fig:example1} on Android library. The
ambiguity in type names is popular in S/O code snippets: e.g., the
simple name \code{getId} occurs 27,434 in various Java
libraries~\cite{liveapi14}.

\subsection{Observations}
\label{sec:obs}

To facilitate the reuse of code snippets in a forum, an automated tool
is needed to derive the fully-qualified names of the API elements in
the snippets so that the proper import statements are added in the
code. To build such a tool, we draw the motivation from the following
observations.

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent {\bf Observation 1} [{\em Regularity of API Usages}]. The
designers of software libraries have the intents for developers to use
the API elements together (including API classes, method calls, field
accesses) in certain combinations/orders to achieve a programming
task. For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:example2} at line 2, in GWT, a
variable of the type \code{Button} (FQN:
\code{com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Button}) is instantiated. Then, at
line 3, to set the handler of that GWT button, one needs to have a
method call to \code{addClickHandler} (FQN:
\code{com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Button.add\-Click\-Handler}) on
the \code{Button} object with an argument of the type
\code{ClickHandler} (FQN:
\code{com\-.google\-.gwt\-.event\-.dom\-.client\-.ClickHandler}). The
API elements are provided and intented to be used in such a
combination. Thus, the API elements frequently appear together in the
API usages of the libraries. Fig.~\ref{fig:example3} shows a complete
example published in the GWT tutorial website
\code{gwtproject.org}. Providing all the proper \code{import}
statements, the author shows how to use the GUI elements in GWT
including \code{Button}. Specifically, at line 23, despite using a
different variable name \code{addStockButton}, the method
\code{addClickHandler} is called on a Button object (declared at line
12) with the argument of the same type \code{ClickHandler}. In brief,
the source code in the public repositories could be a good source for
a model to implicitly learn the API usages to derive the FQNs of the
API elements in an incomplete snippet.

\input{example3.tex}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent {\bf Observation 2} [{\em Dependencies/Relations among API
    Elements in a Usage}]. The dependencies/relations among the API
elements in a API usage can help a model better identify the FQNs of
the elements.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:example3}, the API elements
\code{Button}, \code{addClickHandler}, and \code{ClickHandler} in GWT
have the program dependencies/relations among them. For example, in
GWT, to set a handler for a button, the object of the type
\code{Button} needs to be the {\em receiving object of the method
  call} to \code{addClickHandler}, which in turn needs to accept an
object of the type \code{ClickHandler} as an argument. These relations
exhibit in the client code using the GWT library, and are useful in
deciding the FQNs of its API elements. For example, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:example2},~at line 3, if \code{addClickHandler} is
determined to be the API element
\code{com.\-google.\-gwt.\-user.\-client.\-ui.\-Button.\-add\-Click\-Handler}, the
FQN of the element at line 4 must be
\code{com\-.google\-.gwt\-.event\-.dom\-.client\-.ClickHandler}.  The
other direction of reasoning is applicable as well. In general, if a
model can learn the dependencies/relations among API elements, it
could leverage such knowledge to decide the FQNs of all those APIs at once.


%the lines 2 and 3 in Fig. 2
As another example, the data dependency from the \code{def-use}
relation via the variable \code{myButton} between line 2 and line 3 in
Fig.~\ref{fig:example2} is useful in deriving the FQNs of the
above API elements. If a model decides the FQN for \code{Button} at
line 2 as \code{com\-.google\-.gwt\-.user\-.client\-.ui\-.Button}, it
could derive the FQN of \code{add\-Click\-Handler} at line~3 as
\code{com.\-google.\-gwt.\-user.\-client.\-ui.\-Button.\-add\-Click\-Handler},
and vice versa.

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent {\bf State-of-the-Art Approaches.} Several approaches have
been proposed to automatically recover the fully-qualified names
(FQNs) for the API elements in a code snippet. The {\em
  program-analysis-based} approaches (e.g.,
PPA~\cite{dagenais-oopsla08}, RecoDoc~\cite{dagenais-icse12}), {\em
  information-retrieval-based} approaches (e.g.,
Baker~\cite{liveapi14}, COSTER~\cite{coster-ase19}), and {\em
  constraint-based} approaches (e.g., SnR~\cite{snr-icse22}) suffer
the out-of-vocabulary issue (i.e., could not derive the FQNs that were
not seen in the training corpus).

The advances in {\em Artificial Intelligence (AI)} and {\em Machine
  Learning (ML)} have enabled the generation of the new FQNs for the
APIs. However, those ML-based approaches (e.g., StatType~\cite{icse18}
and Huang {\em et al.}~\cite{prompt-ase22}) still do not leverage the
regularity of API usages and the dependencies/relations among relevant
API elements for FQN recovery. StatType~\cite{icse18} uses
phrase-based statistical machine translation from the code without
FQNs to the one with them.  With short phrases of the lengths of 3-8
tokens, it cannot capture the relevant API elements yet far apart. For
example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:example1}, such short phrases in StatType
cannot make the connections between the API elements \code{mButton}
and \code{setOnClickListener} at line 11 to the relevant API elements
\code{mButton}, \code{findViewById}, etc. at line 8. In other cases,
the two relevant statements that could help the FQN recovery might be
even farther in the code. In contrast, Huang {\em et
  al.}~\cite{prompt-ase22} uses the context of a few lines surrounding
the prediction point (e.g., line 11) for their filling-in approach
with a masked language model. First, a few lines might not capture the
relevant API elements in the same usage. In Fig.~\ref{fig:example1},
\code{mButton} at line 1 is far apart from \code{mButton} at line 8
and \code{mButton} at line 11. Second, each API element might be used
in a different context in the client code. For example, the code at
line 9 in Fig.~\ref{fig:example1} is specific to the method
\code{onCreate} at line 4. Thus, this type of context might not help a
model learn the FQN of an API.
