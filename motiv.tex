\subsection{Motivating Examples}

Let us use a few real-world examples to motivate our approach.
Figure~\ref{fig:example1} displays a code snippet of an answer to an
SO question on Android library. Due to the discussion context in SO,
and its informal nature, code snippets rarely contain sufficient
declarations and references to the fully-qualified names (FQNs). The
code snippets are often missing neccessary import statements and the
references to external types are also often unqualified (without FQNs)
since the responder assumes that those FQNs could be implicitly
understood in the context of the post. In Figure~\ref{fig:example1},
the types \code{Button}, \code{EditText}, \code{Bundle}, \code{View},
and \code{Log} are referenced by simple names only. Thus, the code
will not be compilable if the corresponding import statements are not
added.

Importantly, the name ambiguity occurs in the references to the APIs
of the external libraries. For example, the type \code{Button} at line
1 of Figure~\ref{fig:example1} is a common unqualified type name. In
this snippet, it refers to \code{android.widget.Button}. However, it
is easily ambiguous with other APIs in different libraries that
contain the same concept. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:example2} shows
a code snippet of an answer for an SO post on the Google Web Toolkit
(GWT). Because the code snippet contains no import statement, and the
references to the APIs are unqualified, the type \code{Button} at line
2 is ambiguous with the type of the same name at line 1 of
Figure~\ref{fig:example1} on Android library. The ambiguity in type
names is popular in code snippets in the forums, e.g., the
simple names \code{getId} occur 27,434 in various Java
libraries~\cite{liveapi14}.
