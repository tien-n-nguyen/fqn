\subsection{Data Collection}

\input{data-statistics}

To enable the effectiveness evaluation, we considered six popular Java libraries that developers typically make use of: \code{android}, \code{gwt}, \code{hibernate}, \code{jdk}, \code{joda-time}, and \code{xstream}. This is consistent with prior works on FQN resolution~\cite{icse18, snr-icse22, prompt-ase22}. Among these, StatType\cite{icse18} and SnR\cite{snr-icse22} leverage projects that utilize these libraries. A limitation with this approach is that not all library API elements are covered in their dataset. In contrast, we download these large-scale repositories from GitHub and use their source code itself to build our dataset.

We used Eclipse JDT to parse each project’s source code and resolve all the FQNs. Next, we traversed the ASTs to collect all the methods. Overall, these libraries contain 198,231 methods including 9,764 from \code{android}, 62,782 from \code{gwt}, 105,734 from \code{hibernate-orm}, 5,235 from \code{jdk}, 9,811 from \code{joda-time}, and 4,905 from \code{xstream}. Next, we randomly split these in a 80\%-10\%-10\% ratio, each for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Finally, we applied the TILE algorithm to identify the type inference locations and build the $\langle$\blank-code, FQN$\rangle$ pairs. In Table~\ref{tab:data-stats}, we report the data statistics including the number of APIs in our dataset.


%All the public classes, fields, and methods are counted not including inherited fields and methods. This dataset represents how developers use a wide variety of real Java libraries in practice, and evaluations using this dataset demonstrate that our technique is sound for libraries ranging from small to large. This benchmark which consists of the code snippets and the libraries was obtained from the original benchmark authors Phan et al.

%We used Eclipse JDT to parse each project’s source code and resolve all the FQNs, and built the source and target sentences for all the methods to form a parallel corpus of pairs of sentences.  The projects using Android and JDK have larger numbers of methods using the APIs due to their popularity.
